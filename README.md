# Cypress
Getting practice and running tests on Cypress.


Repo contains documents which were tests on a website using cypress.

Code still not yet fully completed and can be refractured.

Most of the files are extra.
The main content is within:
cypress/integration/dfs/dfs.spec ALL.js


(ignore commented out code)
